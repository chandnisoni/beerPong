#Project : Interactive Beer Pong.

Problem Statement: Keeping track of scores can be difficult while playing Beer Pong. As a beer pong player, I want to automate the task of keeping track of scores. 

Proposed Solution: Designed a prototype for Beer Pong using Breadboard, Arduino Board(Arduino Uno) and photosensor. A photosensor is placed beneath the cup so when the ball lands up in the cup the photosensor detects the interruption in light and hence emits lower readings. Using johnny-five integrated the hardware with software. Also made a simple UI which displays the scoreboard and updates the scoreboard whenever the player scores a point.

Future Prospects:  Integrating the LED light beneath the cup to make it more fun.

Technologies Used:  node.js, express, socket.io, johnny-five. â€¨
